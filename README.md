# Quask_anomaly_detection_embedding_optimizer_extensions
QuASK is an actively maintained library for constructing, studying, and benchmarking quantum kernel methods. Link: https://quask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
This repository contains an extension of that module to the anomaly detection task using an optimizer based on evolutionary algorithms, which allows optimizing the embedding of our circuit to solve outlier detection.
